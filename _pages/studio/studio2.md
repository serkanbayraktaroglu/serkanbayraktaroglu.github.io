Design for Slow Cities / Taraklı

Cittaslow is an organisation founded in Italy and inspired by the slow food movement. Cittaslow's goals include improving the quality of life in towns by slowing down its overall pace, especially in a city's use of spaces and the flow of life and traffic through them. Cittaslow is part of a cultural trend known as the slow movement.

Slow Design is a branch of the Slow Movement, which began with the concept of Slow Food, a term coined in contrast to fast food. As with every branch of the Slow Movement, the overarching goal of Slow Design is to promote well being for individuals, society, and the natural environment. Slow Design seeks a holistic approach to designing that takes into consideration a wide range of material and social factors as well as the short and long term impacts of the design.
Slow Design refers to the goals and approach of the designer, rather than the object of the design. In this way a Slow Design approach can be used within any design field. The term was probably first coined by Alistair Fuad-Luke in his 2002 paper "'Slow Design' - a paradigm for living sustainably?", in which Slow Design is seen as the next step in the development of sustainable design, balancing individual, socio-cultural, and environmental needs.

Design Brief:

Taraklı, is a town of Sakarya which was accepted as a slow city recently. Understand socio-cultural characteristics of the town and examine the needs of inhabitants. Your concept should include design of products and non- material things such as experiences, processes, services, and organizations. In fact, Slow Design may be seen as a path toward the dematerialization required for long- term sustainability as it takes into account the non-material nature of human well being and happiness.

Taraklı is known for  historical Ottoman style buildings, fertile lands, and wood crafts. Thus, student projects were mostly focused on ways to improve and promote crafted products, working conditions of local artisans, and value-added alternatives to local resources. Examples presented below are; compact compost facilities for locals (Basa project by Açelyan Altıntaş), a system design to introduce gardening and compost as an educative tool for children (Eko-egitim by Orkun Tekeli), and a product design and business model focusing on using locally available Gypsophila plant as a cleaning substance (Co - Melda Yanmaz).
