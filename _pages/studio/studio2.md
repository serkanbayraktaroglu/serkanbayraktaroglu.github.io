2012-2013 Spring / ID 402
Product Design Studio VI / Graduation Project
Lect. Serkan Bayraktaroğlu
Design for Slow Cities / Taraklı


Taraklı is known for  historical Ottoman style buildings, fertile lands, and wood crafts. Thus, student projects were mostly focused on ways to improve and promote crafted products, working conditions of local artisans, and value-added alternatives to local resources. Examples presented below are; compact compost facilities for locals (Basa project by Açelyan Altıntaş), a system design to introduce gardening and compost as an educative tool for children (Eko-egitim by Orkun Tekeli), and a product design and business model focusing on using locally available Gypsophila plant as a cleaning substance (Co - Melda Yanmaz).
