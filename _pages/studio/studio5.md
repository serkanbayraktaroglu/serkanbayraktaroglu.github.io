In 2016 Autumn, in collaboration with [Small Project Istanbul](https://www.smallprojectsistanbul.org/) (an NGO working for improving conditions of Syrian refugees in Istanbul and I was a board member at that time) students conducted intensive design research to explore the everyday problems of Syrian refugees. Content analysis of press news, in-depth interviews, and observations at the NGO's social space helped students to design various products and services to increase their wellbeing. Projects have also been exhibited at the [Architecture in Emergency Symposium](https://mim.iku.edu.tr/tr/haberler/architecture-emergency-sempozyum) in 2016. [Exhibition Tag](/images/studio5/AIESergi.pdf)

Attached student works include; 

Chain by Buse Rodoplu: Adaptable furniture for answering the requirements of NGO's social space 
Inserted Space by Valerie Daude: Flexible and simple space-making elements create individual areas for refugees staying in large halls
Jo by Gökçe Göbüt: Interactive toy focusing on PTS
Faleq by Nilgün Özaygün: A food kiosk to be provided by municipalities for refugees. Designed according to municipality regulations and Syrian cuisine food preparation rituals.
