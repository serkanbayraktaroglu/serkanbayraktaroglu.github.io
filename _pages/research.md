## Research Interests

My research explores the dynamic intersections between design, innovation, and sustainability, with a strong emphasis on social impact and education. I am committed to advancing our understanding of how design can address pressing societal and environmental challenges. My work spans several key areas:

## Research Themes

### 1. Sustainability and Circular Economy

My early research centered on **rural development** and sustainability, with a focus on exploring craft practices, **business models**, and **rural innovation**. During my Ph.D., I conducted a six-month field study in rural India, guided by experts like Prof. M.P. Ranjan (NID) and Prof. Anil Gupta (IIM). This investigation examined the impact of design interventions on rural development, highlighting the evolving role of design in social innovation and rural entrepreneurship.

I have long been interested in sustainable Product-Service Systems (PSS). My first conference proceeding explored opportunities and challenges for sustainable PSS in Türkiye through a case study of a local carpet producer. In my teaching, I encourage students to adopt PSS thinking for sustainable design. I’ve also developed courses such as "Strategic Design" at Kadir Has University, which focus on systemic urban interventions through PSS.

More recently, my focus has shifted to the **circular economy** and the role of design in repair and upgrade. I am particularly interested in how DIY repair can strengthen the product-user relationship and brand identity, and how **circular business models** can integrate repair as a value co-creation method. My recent publication, *Redefining Repair as a Value Co-Creation Process for Circular Economy: Facilitated Do-It-Yourself Repair* (International Journal of Design, 2024), examines innovative repair strategies that align with circular economy principles. Additionally, my forthcoming book chapter, *New Product Development Strategies for Societal Welfare: Circular Economy Perspective*, delves into design strategies that enhance societal well-being through circular practices.

- **Ongoing Project**: "Circular Design Awareness and Applications in the Furniture Industry" (2023 - Ongoing), Bilgi University (TR), Istanbul University (TR). This project explores opportunities and challenges for circular economy transition in Türkiye's furniture industry.

My current research includes studying **design for repair** as a strategy for the circular economy, including DIY repair practices and speculative design for future repair scenarios in collaboration with a colleague from Lucerne University, Switzerland.

### 2. (Eco)Social Innovation

My work in design for social innovation focuses on leveraging design to address social challenges, particularly in rural contexts. In *Bridging Roles of Social Innovations in Rural Development: Craft Initiatives from Kutch, India* (Journal of Design for Resilience in Architecture and Planning, 2020), I explore how craft initiatives contribute to rural development and social resilience. This research builds on my Ph.D. thesis, *Investigating Design for Social Innovation Through Business Models in Rural India*, which proposed a model for fostering social innovation in developing countries. My article *Eco-social Innovation in the Context of Urban Sustainability* (in Turkish) is accepted for publication as a book chapter in 2024.

- **Supervision Committee**: "Social Innovation Ecosystems in Sustainable Rural Development" (Ongoing Ph.D. project), Istanbul Technical University.

### 3. Design Education

I integrate my research findings into my teaching, particularly in courses related to sustainability, strategic design, and **systems thinking**. My lectures on Systems Thinking and Legal Design, along with workshops like the SubjectSpace – AI Experience Workshop, reflect my commitment to advancing design education through innovative methodologies and real-world applications. This approach is evident in the interdisciplinary Master’s program in City and Children Studies that I helped establish, blending academic and practical perspectives to address urban and societal challenges.

- **Thesis Supervision**: "Artificial Intelligence in the Creative Processes of Design" (MSc thesis, 2024), Istanbul University. Results from this research have been presented at a conference *(Integration of Infinity: A Design Workshop Experience with Generative AI)*, exploring the intersection of design and **artificial intelligence**. These findings are being prepared for publication.

### 4. Ongoing Collaborations and Grants

I am actively engaged in international research projects and collaborations that explore urban sustainability transitions and the role of design in fostering eco-social innovation.

- **ENCODUS: Excellence in Eco-Social Design for Urban Sustainability Transition** (2023, Above Threshold). Horizon Europe Project with partners from Switzerland, Germany, and Italy.

### Future Research Directions

Looking ahead, I plan to deepen my research in the following areas:
- **Design for Circular Economy and Product-Service Systems**
- **Social Aspects of Sustainability Transitions in Urban Contexts**
- **Leveraging Design Education for Future Sustainability Challenges**

I continue to explore opportunities for participatory design processes, especially involving vulnerable user groups, and aim to incorporate emerging technologies like AI in design education and research.
