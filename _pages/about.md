I am a design researcher working in the field of sustainability, innovation and development. Following to my undergraduate education in industrial engineering, I completed Industrial Design and Manufacturing MA at Dortmund TU and Twente University. For my master thesis I studied the role of communication in complex product development processes in a project conducted by Munich TU and Audi AG. I have I earned my Ph.D. in Industrial Design from Istanbul Technical University.  

Since 2010 Iâ€™ve been teaching numerous undergraduate and graduate level theoretical and practical courses, researching about design for social innovation, sustainability and circular design.
