I am a design researcher working in the field of sustainability, innovation and development. Following to my undergraduate education in industrial engineering, I completed Industrial Design and Manufacturing MA at Dortmund TU and Twente University. For my master thesis I studied the role of communication in complex product development processes in a project conducted by Munich TU and Audi AG. I have I earned my Ph.D. in Industrial Design from Istanbul Technical University.  

Since 2010 Iâ€™ve been teaching numerous undergraduate and graduate level theoretical and practical courses, researching about design for social innovation, sustainability and circular design. I have coordinated sustainablity themed design studio courses in various udnergraduate levels, developed and lectured many theoretical and practical courses including; strategic design, sustainablity in design, design innovation and product development, desing research, materials and manufacturing techniques in design, systems thinking in design, design for social innovation.

In collarobation with national and international partners including Bernard van Leer Foundation, Superpool Architecture and local municipalities of Istanbul I have coordinated the establishment of "City and Children Studies MA" in 2018 at Kadir Has University. Additionally I have coordinated the Design for Social Innovation and Strategic Design tracks under the Design MA between 2016-2020.

Since 2020 I've been working at Istanbul University, Industrial Design Department and while lecturing in graduate and undergraduate level courses, I develop my researches in design for repair and circular design.
