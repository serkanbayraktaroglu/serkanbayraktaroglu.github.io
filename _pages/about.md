I am a design researcher working at the intersection of **design, innovation, business models,** and the **societal aspects of sustainability and design education**. My work is driven by a commitment to advancing sustainable solutions through design.

I hold an undergraduate degree in **Industrial Engineering** and completed a dual Master's in **Industrial Design and Manufacturing** at **Dortmund Technical University** and the **University of Twente**. My Master’s thesis explored the role of communication in complex product development processes, in collaboration with **Munich Technical University** and **Audi AG**. I earned my Ph.D. in **Industrial Design** from **Istanbul Technical University**, with a thesis titled *"Investigating Design for Social Innovation Through Business Models in Rural India: A Model Proposal for Developing Countries."*

Since 2010, I have taught a wide range of **undergraduate and graduate courses** on product, service, and systems design. My teaching experience includes coordinating **sustainability-themed product design studios** at various levels, often in collaboration with industrial and social organizations. I have developed and delivered courses in areas such as **strategic design, sustainability in design, design innovation and product development, design research, materials and manufacturing techniques, systems thinking in design,** and **design for social innovation**.

### Key achievements:
- In 2020, I worked at İstanbul University on establishing the *Industrial Design* undergraduate program which accepted its first students at 2023.
- In 2018, I coordinated the establishment of the [*City and Children Studies MA*](https://city-and-children-studies.tumblr.com/) program at **Kadir Has University**, in collaboration with national and international partners, including the **Bernard van Leer Foundation, Superpool Architecture,** and **local municipalities of Istanbul**.
- From 2016 to 2020, I led the **Design for Social Innovation** and **Strategic Design** tracks in the **Design MA** program.
- Since 2020, I have been at **Istanbul University** the oldest and largest public university in Türkiye, where I contributed to the establishment of the [Industrial Design undergraduate program](https://mimarlik.istanbul.edu.tr/en/), which welcomed its first cohort in 2023.

Currently, I am engaged in research and teaching in **design for repair, circular design,** and **eco-social innovation**. My future research will focus on:
- **Designing for the circular economy** and developing **product-service systems** for industries.
- Investigating the **social aspects of sustainability transitions**, particularly within **urban contexts**.
- Exploring opportunities to leverage **design education** in addressing **future sustainability challenges**.

By combining these areas of focus, I aim to further contribute to the development of innovative and socially impactful design solutions.
