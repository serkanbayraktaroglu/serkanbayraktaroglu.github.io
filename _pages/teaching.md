Since 2010, teaching has been an important element of my academic life, and research has often played a central role in my teaching. Design studio courses often form the backbone of the industrial design curriculum. My studio classes at Kadir Has University were both a platform for students to learn through design research and practice, and an opportunity to explore contemporary design issues.

As such, studio courses i have instructed range from traditional product design and development processes to conceptual designs. In line with my research area, I have often shaped design studios under the themes of sustainability.
